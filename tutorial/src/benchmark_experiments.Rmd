Benchmark Experiments
=====================


In order to get an unbiased estimate of the performance on new data,
it is generally not enough to simply use repeated cross-validation
for a given set of hyperparameters and methods (see section [tuning](tune.md)), 
as this might produce an overly optimistic result.

A better (although more time-consuming) approach is to nest two
resampling methods. To keep it simple, let's take
cross-validations, which in this case is also called "double cross-validation".
In the so called "outer" cross-validation the data is split repeatedly
into a (larger) training set and a (smaller) test set in the usual
way. Now, in every outer iteration the learner is tuned on the
training set by performing an "inner" cross-validation. The best
hyperparameters are selected and afterwards used for fitting the learner 
to the complete "outer" training set. The resulting model is used to
on the (outer) test set. This results in much more reliable
estimates of the true performance distribution of the learner for unseen
data. These can now be used to estimate locations (e.g. of the mean
or median performance value) and compare learning methods in a fair
way.

In the following we will see four examples to show different benchmark settings:

* One data set  +	two classification algorithms
* One data set	+	one classification algorithm	+	tuning
* Three data sets	+	three classification algorithms	+	tuning
* One data set	+	two classification algorithms	+	variable selection


Example 1: One task, two learners, no tuning
----------------------------------------------

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("mlr")

## Classification task with iris data set 
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")

## Two learners to be compared 
learners = c("classif.lda", "classif.qda")

## Define cross-validation indices 
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 5)

res = bench.exp(learners, task, rdesc)
``` 

The above code should be self-explanatory. In the result every
column corresponds to one learner. The entries show the mean test
error and its standard deviation for the final fitted model.

But the benchmark results contain much more information, which you can
access if you want to see details. Let's have a look at the benchmark
result from the example above:


```{r eval=FALSE}
## Access further information 
## The single performances of the cross-validation runs 
res["perf"]

## Confusion matrices - one for each learner
res["conf.mats"]
``` 
	
Example 2: One task, one learner, tuning
----------------------------------------

Now we have a learner with hyperparameters and we want to find the best ones. In
that case we have two resampling levels.

We show an example with outer bootstrap and inner cross-validation,
our learner will be k-nearest neighbour.

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Classification task with iris data set 
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")

## Range of hyperparameter k  
ps = makeParameterSet(makeDiscreteParameter("k", 1:5))
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid(ranges = ps)

## Define "inner" cross-validation indices
inner.rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)   

## Tune k-nearest neighbour
lrn = makeTuneWrapper("classif.kknn",
                               resampling = inner.rdesc, 
                               control = ctrl)

## Define "outer" bootstrap indices 
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("BS", iters = 5)

## Merge it into a benchmark experiment 
## Choose accuracy instead of default measure mean misclassification error
res = bench.exp(lrn, task, rdesc, measure = acc)
	
## What performances did we get in the single runs? 
res["perf"]

## What parameter setting achieved this performances? 
res["tuned.par"]

## What does the confusion matrix look like? 
res["conf.mats"]
``` 

Of course everything works the same way if we change the resampling
strategy either in the outer or inner run. They can be mixed as desired.

Example 3: Three tasks, three learners, tuning
----------------------------------------------

Now we look at an extensive example that shows a benchmark experiment with three data
sets, three learners and tuning.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("dprep")
library("mlbench")
data(BreastCancer)
data(Vehicle)

## Classification task with three data sets 
task1 = makeClassifTask("Iris", data = iris, target = "Species")
task2 = makeClassifTask("Vehicle", data = Vehicle, target = "Class")
task3 = makeClassifTask("BreastCancer", data = na.omit(BreastCancer), 
                         target = "Class", excluded = "Id")
	
## Merge to one task
tasks = list(task1 , task2 , task3)
	
## Very small grid for SVM hyperparameters  
ps = makeParameterSet(makeDiscreteParameter("C", 2^seq(-1,1)), 
                      makeDiscreteParameter("sigma", 2^seq(-1,1)))
ctrl = makeTuneControlGrid(ranges = ps)

## Define "inner" cross-validation indices
inner.rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)   

## Tune a SVM
lrn = makeTuneWrapper("classif.ksvm", method = "grid", resampling = inner.rdesc, 
                       control = ctrl)

## Three learners to be compared 
learners = c("classif.lda", "classif.rpart", lrn)

## Define "outer" cross-validation indices 
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 5)

## Merge it to a benchmark experiment 
res = bench.exp(learners, tasks, rdesc)
	
## Only for one task
res["perf", task = "Iris"]

## Only for one learner
res["perf", learner = "classif.lda"]
		
## Tuned parameter for SVM
res["tuned.par", learner = "classif.ksvm"]

## Confusion matrix for one learner and one task
res["conf.mats", learner = "classif.rpart", task = "BreastCancer"]
	
## Optimal performance of the inner (!) resampling, i.e. here 3-fold cross-validation
res["opt.perf", learner = "classif.ksvm"]
```

Example 4: One task, two learners, variable selection
-----------------------------------------------------

Let's see how we can do [feature selection](feature_selection.md) in
a benchmark experiment:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Classification task with iris data set 
task = makeClassifTask("iris", data=iris, target = "Species")  
	
## Control object for feature selection
ctrl = makeFeatselControlSequential(beta = 100, method="sfs")

## Inner resampling
inner.rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iter=2)

## Feature selection with Sequential Forward Search
lrn = makeFeatselWrapper("classif.lda", resampling = inner.rdesc, control = ctrl)

## Let's compare two learners
learners = c("classif.rpart", lrn)

## Define outer resampling 
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("subsample", iter = 3)

## Merge to a benchmark experiment
res = bench.exp(tasks = task, learners = learners, resampling = rdesc)
	
## Which features have been selected (in the outer resampling steps)?
res["sel.var", learner="classif.lda"]
```
