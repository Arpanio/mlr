Integrating another measure
===========================

Maybe you want to evaluate a prediction with a measure which is not yet implemented 
in **mlr**. This could be either a performance measure which is not included in the in **mlr**
list of \man[measures] or a measure that uses a non-standard misclassification cost matrix.


Construct performance measure
-----------------------------

The \man[makeMeasure] function provides a simple way of constructing your own performance 
measure. Below, this is exemplified by an implementation of the mean 
misclassification error (mmce) for the iris dataset. For this purpose we write a simple 
function that computes the measure on the basis of the predictions and subsequently wrap it 
in a \man[Measure] object. Then, we work with it as usual with the
[performance](http://berndbischl.github.io/mlr/man/performance.html) function.
See the R documentation of the \man[makeMeasure] function for details on the
various parameters.

```{splus}
# Define the measure.
my.mmce = function(task, model, pred, extra.args) {
  tb = table(pred$data$response, pred$data$truth)
  1 - sum(diag(tb)) / sum(tb)
}

# Encapsulate the function with a Measure object.
my.mmce = makeMeasure(id = "my.mmce", minimize = TRUE, classif = TRUE, 
                       allowed.pred.types = "response", fun = my.mmce)

# Create classification task and learner
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")
lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")
mod = train(lrn, task)
pred = predict(mod, newdata= iris)

# Compare predicted and true label with our measure.
performance(pred, measures = my.mmce)

# Apparently the result coincides with the mlr implementaion.
performance(pred, measures = mmce)
```


Construct measure for non-standard misclassification costs
----------------------------------------------------------

To create a measure that involves non-standard misclassification costs you can use
the \man[makeCostMeasure] function. In order to do this, you first need to define the cost
matrix you want to use and include all class labels. The cost matrix can then be 
wrapped in a \man[Measure] object and a prediction can be evaluated as usual with the
\man[performance] function. See the R documentation of the \man[makeCostMeasure] function for 
details on the various parameters.

```{splus}
# Create misclassification cost matrix.
mcm = matrix(c(0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0), ncol=3, 
              dimnames = list(c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"),
                              c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica")))
          
# Create classification task and learner
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")
lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")
mod = train(lrn, task)
pred = predict(mod, newdata= iris)
          
# Encapsulate the cost matrix in a Measure object.                             
my.costs = makeCostMeasure(id = "costs", minimize = TRUE, costs=mcm, task, aggregate = mean)

# Compare predicted and true label with our measure.
performance(pred, measures = my.costs)
```
