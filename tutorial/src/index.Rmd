# mlr TutorialThis web page will provide you with an in-depth introduction on how touse the **mlr** framework for machine learning experiments andoptimization in R.Our focus is on your comprehension of the basic functions and applications.For detailed technical information and manual pages, please refer to the package's [manual pages](http://berndbischl.github.io/mlr/man/).They are regularly updated and reflect the documentation of the current package version on CRAN.The tutorial explains the basic analysis of a data set step by step:* What is your data and the aim of your analysis?* How do you select learning algorithms and set them up?* How to predict given new data?* How to evaluate models and their predictions?* How to tune models?* How to select important features?* How to conduct a comparison study?We present various simple examples from classification and regressionduring this tutorial to illustrate the main features of thepackage.Enjoy reading!## Quick startA simple stratified cross-validation of the *linear discriminant analysis* with **mlr**.```{r}library(mlr)data(iris)# Define the Task:tsk = makeClassifTask(id = "tutorial", data = iris, target = "Species")# Define the Learner:lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")# Define the Resampling Strategy:rsm = makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", stratify = TRUE)# Do the resampling:res = resample(learner = lrn, task = tsk, resampling = rsm, show.info = FALSE)# Get the mean misclassification error:res$aggr```
